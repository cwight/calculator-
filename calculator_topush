//now for the if statements…i looked into using switch statements, but went with ifs..maybe a little longer

  if($action=="+"){

        echo $value1+$value2;

        }

 //remember to keep track of indentions

//this method 'worked' but i also looked into doing recursive descent parsers …i think this too would work
